    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We want to make everyone - people of all ages - play. Every day. Find joy in little hand-made things. Our paper products are often vintage-inspired and whimsical with varied uses. Everything we make under Sky Goodies must qualify as a ‘goody’; something that looks delicious, or brings a bit of joy to everyday life. Patterns and colors are very Indian, and Truck Art is a big inspiration for many of the colorful products. Our best-seller typewriter calendars are popular among all age groups, both men and women. All our DIY products are great for kids, as they encourage creativity, and hone their logic and motor skills. The DIYs make great social and indoor activities, both in homes and offices.</p>
